You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]

class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int len = ratings.size(), ans = 0;
        if(len == 0) return 0;
        vector<int> t(len, 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < len; i++){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) t[i] = t[i - 1] + 1;
        }
        ans = t[len - 1];
        for(int i = len - 2; i >= 0; i--){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) t[i] = max(t[i], t[i + 1] + 1);
            ans += t[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
